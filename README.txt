iPhone Viewport Meta helps optimize your WordPress install for the iPhone and iPod Touch by inserting the meta viewport element into the head element of pages generated by WordPress.

Important: this plugin works best with themes derived from Sandbox (http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/)

== Details ==

iPhone Viewport Meta does the following:

* if a request comes from an iPhone or iPod Touch it adds a meta tag and additional styles definitions to optimize content for that browser and it scrolls the location bar up and out of the way after the page loads
* it adds a template tag you can use in your theme to manage inclusion or exclusion of content

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin archive and expand it (you've likely already done this).
2. Put the 'iphone-viewport-meta.php' file into your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Go to the Plugins page in your WordPress Administration area and click 'Activate' for iphone viewport meta.

== Configuration ==

This plugin has no configuration settings.

== Template Tags ==

This plugin defines a template tag that can be used to prevent generation of content such as sidebars, when viewed by iPhones and iPod Touch:

`<?php if (!function_exists('weh_is_iPhone') || (function_exists('weh_is_iPhone') && !weh_is_iPhone())) : // don't send extra bits to iPhone ?>`
    `<?php get_sidebar() ?>`
`<?php endif; // testing for iPhone ?>`

== Hooks/API ==

No hooks or APIs are defined by this plugin.

== Known Issues ==

* This plugin works best with themes derived from Sandbox (http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/)
* You will need to use the weh_is_iPhone() template tag to control the display of sidebars.
* This plugin depends on the user agent string sent by mobile Safari.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

I don't have an iPhone or iPod Touch. How do I test my site?

You can add `forceiphone=y` to the query string for any page on your WordPress site to force the iPhone behavior.
